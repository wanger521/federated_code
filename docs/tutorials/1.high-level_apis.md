# Tutorial 1: High-level APIs

RobustFL provides three types of high-level APIs: **initialization**, **registration**, and **execution**.
The initialization API initializes RobustFL with configurations. 
Registration APIs register customized components into the platform. 
Execution APIs start robust federated learning process. 
These APIs are listed in the table below.

| API Name      | Description | Category 
| :---        |    :----:   | :--- |
| init(config) | Initialize RobustFL with configurations | Initialization | 
| register_dataset(train, test, val) | Register a customized dataset loader| Registration | 
| register_model(model) | Register a customized model | Registration | 
| register_controller(controller) | Register a customized controller | Registration |
| register_node(node) | Register a customized node | Registration |
| register_graph(graph) | Register a customized graph | Registration |
| register_aggregation(aggregation) | Register a customized aggregation rule | Registration |
| register_attack(attack) | Register a customized attack | Registration |
| run() | Start federated learning for standalone training | Execution |


`init(config):` Initialize RobustFL with provided configurations (`config`) or default configurations if not specified.  
These configurations determine the training hardware and hyperparameters.

`register_<module>:` Register customized modules to the system. 
RobustFL supports the registration of customized datasets, models, controller, node, graph, aggregation and attack, replacing the default modules in FL training. In the experimental phase, users can register newly developed algorithms to understand their performance.

`run():` The API is commands to trigger execution, starts FL using standalone training or distributed training. 

Next, we introduce how to use these APIs with examples.

## Standalone Training Example

_**Standalone training**_ means that federated learning (FL) training is run on a single hardware device, such as your personal computer and a single GPU or CPU.

To run any federated learning process, we need to first call the initialization API and then use the execution API. Registration is optional.

The simplest way is to run with the default setup. 
```python
import src
# Initialize federated learning with default configurations.
src.init()
# Execute federated learning training.
src.run()
```

You can run it with specified configurations. 
```python
import src

# Customized configuration.
config = {
    "data": {"dataset": "Cifar10", "partition_type": "iid"},
    "controller": {"rounds": 5, "nodes_per_round": 2},
    "node": {"local_epoch": 5},
    "model": "resnet18"
}
# Initialize federated learning with default configurations.
src.init(config)
# Execute federated learning training.
src.run()
```

You can also run federated learning with customized datasets, model, controller and node implementations.

Note: `registration` must be done before `initialization`.

```python
import src
from src.node import BaseNode

# Inherit BaseNode to implement customized node operations.
class CustomizedNode(BaseNode):
    def __init__(self, cid, conf, train_data, test_data, device, **kwargs):
        super(CustomizedNode, self).__init__(cid, conf, train_data, test_data, device, **kwargs)
        pass  # more initialization of attributes.

    def train(self, conf, device):
        pass # Implement customized training method, overwriting the default one.

# Register customized node.
src.register_node(CustomizedNode)
# Initialize federated learning with default configurations.
src.init()
# Execute federated learning training.
src.run()
```
