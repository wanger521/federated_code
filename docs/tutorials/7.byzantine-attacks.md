# Tutorial 7: Byzantine attacks

RobustFL supports numerous attacks and allows you to customize the attack.

## Out-of-the-box Attacks

To use these attacks, you can set configurations `attack_type: <attack_name>`. 

We currently provide `NoAttack`, `Gaussian`, `SignFlipping`, `SampleDuplicating`, `ZeroValue`, `Isolation` , `LittleEnough`, `AGRFang`, `AGRTailored`

## Customized Attacks

RobustFL allows training with a wide range of attacks by providing the flexibility to customize attacks. 
You can customize and register attacks in one way: register as a class. Either way, the basic is to **inherit and implement the `src.attacks.base_attack.BaseAttack`**. 

### Register as a Class

In the example below, we implement and conduct RobustFL training with a `CustomizedAttack`. 

It is applicable when the attack does not require extra arguments to initialize.

```python
import torch
from src.datas.make_data import FEATURE_TYPE
from src.attacks.base_attack import BaseAttack

# Define a customized attack class.
class CustomizedAttack(BaseAttack):
    """
    Example: No attack.
    """

    def __init__(self, graph, *args, **kwargs):
        super(CustomizedAttack, self).__init__(name='CustomizedAttack', graph=graph)

    def run_one_node(self, all_messages, selected_nodes_cid, node, new_graph=None, *args, **kwargs):
        return all_messages

# Register the customized attack class.
src.register_attack(CustomizedAttack)
# Initialize RobustFL.
src.init()
# Execute FL training.
src.run()
```
