# Tutorial 6: Aggregations

RobustFL supports numerous aggregation rules and allows you to customize the aggregation rule.

## Out-of-the-box Aggregations

To use these aggregations, you can set configurations `aggregation_rule: <aggregation_name>`. 

We currently provide `Mean`, `MeanWeightMH`, `NoCommunication`, `Median`, `GeometricMedian`, `Krum`, `MKrum`, `TrimmedMean`, `RemoveOutliers`, `Faba`, `Phocas`, `IOS`, `Brute`, `Bulyan` , `CenteredClipping`, `SignGuard`, `Dnc`

## Customized Aggregations

RobustFL allows training with a wide range of aggregations by providing the flexibility to customize aggregations. 
You can customize and register aggregations in one way: register as a class. Either way, the basic is to **inherit and implement the `src.aggregations.base_aggregation.DistributedAggregation`**. 

### Register as a Class

In the example below, we implement and conduct RobustFL training with a `CustomizedAggregation`. 

It is applicable when the aggregation does not require extra arguments to initialize.

```python
import copy
import itertools
import math
import torch
from scipy import stats
from geom_median.torch import compute_geometric_median

from src.datas.make_data import FEATURE_TYPE
from src.library.logger import create_logger
from src.aggregations.base_aggregation import DistributedAggregation

# Define a customized aggregation class.
class CustomizedAggregation(DistributedAggregation):
    """
    Mean aggregation.
    Args:
        graph (graph): the class graph, including  CompleteGraph, ErdosRenyi, TwoCastle, RingCastle, OctopusGraph.
        If graph is centralized, we use CompleteGraph for default.
    """
    def __init__(self, graph, *args, **kwargs):
        super(Mean, self).__init__(name='mean',
                                   graph=graph)

    def run_one_node(self, all_messages, selected_nodes_cid, node, *args, **kwargs):
        neighbor_messages = self.neighbor_messages_and_itself(all_messages, node, selected_nodes_cid)
        return torch.unsqueeze(torch.mean(neighbor_messages, dim=0), dim=0)

# Register the customized aggregation class.
src.register_aggregation(CustomizedAggregation)
# Initialize RobustFL.
src.init()
# Execute FL training.
src.run()
```
